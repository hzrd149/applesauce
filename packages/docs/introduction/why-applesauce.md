# Why AppleSauce

The goal of the applesauce packages is not to make nostr app development easier, but to make it simpler

Making development easier would imply making it safer and removing the risk of breaking things. removing the ability to experiment

That is why the goal is to make development simpler. If writing a nostr app is simpler then we can experiment more and still learn when things break
