# Why AppleSauce

The goal of the applesauce packages is not to make nostr app development easier, but make it simpler

Making development easier would imply making it safer and removing the risk of breaking things and removing the ability to experiment

By making development simpler my goal is to ensure you can still break things and try crazy ideas, but you will be writing less code
